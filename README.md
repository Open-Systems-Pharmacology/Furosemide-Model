## Furosemide-Model
Mechanistic PBPK model of furosemide (clinical OAT substrate)
 
### Repository files
Within this repository, we share a whole-body PBPK model of furosemide. The model was developed using data of 42 clinical studies (dosing range 1–80 mg), and qualified for DDI prediction with the OAT perpetrator drug probenecid.For further details and documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
